description: Introduction to Partial Differential Equations in Fribourg in 2025
---

This semester, I will be teaching a course on Partial Differential Equations (PDE), based on L. C. Evans' "Partial Differential Equations". 
The course is intended for third-year undergraduate and master's students.

The course is structured around the study of the three most important differential equations:
the Laplace, heat and wave equations.
These three equations have been the source of numerous mathematical developments, both pure and applied.
We will commence by learning the classical methods for deriving properties of their solutions.
Subsequently, we will delve into a more advanced approach, studying distributions, Sobolev spaces and weak solutions. 
These theoretical instruments will enable us to introduce new methods for investigating PDE.


Weekly schedule:
Monday and Tuesday, 13:15 - 15:00, in PER 23, Room 0.05
	
Codes: [SMA.03554](https://www.unifr.ch/timetable/en/course.html?show=122181)
and [SMA.04554](https://www.unifr.ch/timetable/en/course.html?show=122182)

## Material

I give you access to [my notes](https://github.com/Seba272/2025-01-09-IntroductionToPDE_public).
It is a [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository: you can clone or fork the repository, or you can download the source files.
**Danger**: These are NOT lecture notes: these are my personal notes, on which I work to prepare the lectures, and they will keep changing quite a lot.
You should have a similar document for yourself.
It is not necessary to use LaTeX, or a computer: paper and pen can work equally well.
However, it is necessary that you write all proofs yourself: add and subtract details, polish your text until every single step is justified. 
Dig into your uncertainities!
