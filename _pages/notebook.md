Use of "any"
------------

It is better not to use "any" in mathematics, beacuse its meaning depends on the context.
In English, "for any $$x$$" can mean both "for all $$x$$", i.e., $$\forall x$$, and "for some $$x$$", i.e., $$\exists x$$.
The choice depends on the context: this is not admissible in mathematics.

Here are two examples from [wordreference.com](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/any):
1. *I'll watch any film.*  
	 (I will not watch all movies, but I will just not choose)
2. *Any teenager can tell you how useful the internet can be.*  
	 (All teenagers can answer the question, because you don't need to choose a specific one)
